#This directory contains scripts and code for generating Fst results

#The script Baseline_Fst.R was used to generate Fst pairwise between each cage/time point sample, and the baseline population

#The script BiolReps_ECage_Fst.R was used to generate Fst pairwise between all biological replicate samples

#The script TechReps_Fst.R was used to generate Fst pairwise between all techincal replicate samples

#The notebook FstAnalysis_orch2021_Final.ipynb was used for statistical analysis and plotting of Fst results
