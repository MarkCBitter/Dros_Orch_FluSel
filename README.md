# Dros_Orch_FluSel
Code and allele frequency data repository for analysis of 2021 Drosophila melanogaster mesocosm data
Each subdirectory contains a seaparate README file containing specific information regarding the data and code within the directory.

The orch2021_functions.R script in the main directory is source code that contains functions that are called upon in many of the scripts and notebooks used in the various subdirectories.

The allele frequency files used in these analyses are too large to upload to github. 
You can access the raw reads the NCBI SRA: X
